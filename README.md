# CSE474-Project
Final project for CSE474 Machine Learning on NBA Score prediction.

The code is written in Python in a Jupyter Notebook. To run it you need Jupyter Notebook installed, simply open the file and run the code.

The GUI is in predictor.py. Since Gradient Tree gave us the most accuracy, we are using that for the model.
Tkinter is needed to run the GUI. By default python 3.7+ should come with tkinter.
